# Icarus Clock Widget

This is a description for my app "Icarus Watch", which can be found in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.thrakbad.icaruswatch) or as an [APK download](https://goo.gl/32YtsJ).

It is a custom widget for Android devices solely created for the Sci-Fi LARP [ICARUS](http://www.grv.it/icarus/) by [Terre Spezzate](http://www.grv.it/en). Players bringing their Android devices to the game can use this widget to see the time in the Icarus station 14-hour system instead of the 24h earth system.

## Instructions

1. Install the app
2. Open the app
3. Choose your run mandatory and shift and additional options
4. Leave the app via the back button
5. Got to your home-screen (called launcher in Android terminology) and add the widget called "IcarusWatch" or "Icarus Clock Widget" to your home-screen. If you do not know how to add a widget to your home-screen/launcher, just google "How to add Android widget to <your device name or your launcher name>", and you will certainly find a short guide. Most of the times it involves long-pressing an empty area on your screen.

## Functions

With the clock you can
* customize the colours of the clock

## Troubleshooting

I basically put this together in a few hours, so there is a chance that it might not work on your device. I am a professional Android developer, however, so I hope it will only break in edge cases, and work for most of you.
