# Icarus Clock Widget

This is a description for my app "Icarus Watch", which can be found in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.thrakbad.icaruswatch) or as an [APK download](https://goo.gl/32YtsJ).

It is a custom widget for Android devices solely created for the Sci-Fi LARP [ICARUS](http://www.grv.it/icarus/) by [Terre Spezzate](http://www.grv.it/en). Players bringing their Android devices to the game can use this widget to see the time in the Icarus station 14-hour system instead of the 24h earth system. The clock is running on the Icarus system, so that it will hit D15 4:00 when the game starts on Friday the 10th/17th at 22h.

## Instructions

1. Install the app
2. Open the app
3. Choose your run mandatory and shift and additional options
4. Leave the app via the back button
5. Got to your home-screen (called launcher in Android terminology) and add the widget called "IcarusWatch" or "Icarus Clock Widget" to your home-screen. If you do not know how to add a widget to your home-screen/launcher, just google "How to add Android widget to <your device name or your launcher name>", and you will certainly find a short guide. Most of the times it involves long-pressing an empty area on your screen.

## Functions

If you would like any cool features, I will still have time to add a few small things. Please contact me (see below) if you have a cool idea.

With the clock you can
* fully customize the colours of the clock
* select your shift and the clock will tell you when it is time to sleep
* customize the sleep schedule or leave it according to the calendar in the design document
* apply an offset to the station time, in case the game starts early or late

## Troubleshooting
I basically put this together in a few hours, so there is a chance that it might not work on your device. I am a professional Android developer, however, so I hope it will only break in edge cases, and work for most of you.

* If the clock ever gets stuck, tapping on it re-initialises the update process.
* If tapping on the clock does not help, re-add it. All your settings will remain intact.
* If the widget shows "This should not happen" the update process did not start, and tapping on it will not work. If re-adding it won't solve the problem, contact me (see below).
